# skyblock.net price scraper
This script runs a bot on the server skyblock.net for the purpose of automatic price scraping from signs. From a yaml file, this bot is configured to go to various user islands and cordinates (for if their island is too big for all signs to fit in the render distance) and dump all shop signs into a csv file. This allows you to quickly and accurately find the best price for any given item, and who is buying them for the best profit.

Using this script you can very easily find people selling for lower then others are buying, allowing you to be the greedy middle man meteoriting transactions between users.

## useablity
Unfortunetly, as this was a script intended for my use only, so values are veyr hard coded. If you're looking to use this script though, changing out the username and password should be enough to get it going. You may want to edit the yaml file though.

#### Side note
Yes, I know my username and password are in the git history. I created this a while ago not expecting to ever put this on github, I'd never hard code things like this in projects I think anyone else will use or look at. A while later though, I decided I might as well put it up if I took the time to write it. Dosen't harm anything

Also, those credentials have been long changed.
